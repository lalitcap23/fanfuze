## Project Description
This project is a blockchain-powered platform that introduces **Token-Gated Flash Drops**, a revolutionary way for clubs and organizations to engage with their most loyal fans. Built on the **Chiliz blockchain**, the platform allows fans to access exclusive, time-sensitive offers and rewards by owning specific fan tokens. These tokens unlock limited-time opportunities that can include rare merchandise, event tickets, exclusive content, and more.

The platform aims to bridge the gap between clubs and their fan base by leveraging decentralization to offer transparent, secure, and verifiable fan engagement. Each fan token acts as a gateway to these exclusive drops, ensuring that only the most devoted supporters can claim the rewards. The use of smart contracts on the Chiliz blockchain ensures that all transactions are trustless, efficient, and immutable, providing a seamless experience for both fans and clubs.

## How It's Made

### Blockchain
We built this project on the **Chiliz blockchain**, which is designed for fan engagement, making it the perfect choice for our platform. The **FAN token** on Chiliz plays a central role, allowing fans to unlock exclusive flash drops, rewards, and experiences. By using Chiliz, weâ€™re able to create a secure and transparent system that connects clubs with their most dedicated supporters.

### Frontend
For the frontend, we used **Next.js**, ensuring the website loads quickly and performs well even under heavy use. **Tailwind CSS** was used to style the website, helping us quickly build a clean and responsive design. To make the site more interactive, we added animations using **Framer Motion**, giving users a smooth and engaging experience.

### Smart Contracts and Integration
On the blockchain side, we developed the smart contracts using **Solidity**. These contracts manage the logic of fan tokens and determine who is eligible for the exclusive flash drops. We integrated **Ethers.js** to connect the frontend with the Chiliz blockchain, allowing us to handle transactions and check token balances easily and in real time.

### Storage
For secure storage of images, we chose **IPFS**. This decentralized storage solution ensures that images related to fan rewards are safely stored, without relying on traditional servers. This gives fans confidence that their media is protected.
